# Chronal

`chronal` is a simple command line stopwatch that I use to keep track of how
long I perform deep work tasks.

### Usage

`chronal <command>`

### Commands

- **start**: starts the stopwatch
- **stop**: stops the stopwatch and outputs the time in minutes
- **current**: Displays the current time on the stopwatch, but does not stop it
- **live**: A live updating view. Use ctrl+c to exit live view, but the
  stopwatch will continue to run in the background
